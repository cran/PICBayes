Description: Contains functions to fit proportional hazards (PH) model to partly interval-censored (PIC) data (Pan et al. (2020) <doi:10.1177/0962280220921552>), PH model with spatial frailty to spatially dependent PIC data (Pan and Cai (2021) <doi:10.1080/03610918.2020.1839497>), and mixed effects PH model to clustered PIC data. Each random intercept/random effect can follow both a normal prior and a Dirichlet process mixture prior. It also includes the corresponding functions for general interval-censored data.
